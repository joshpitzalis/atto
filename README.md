# Atto
An Atomic Flexbox CSS Framework.

**Atto**: A unit prefix in the metric system denoting one trillionth.

+ Currently 0.006 mb [minified](http://www.minifier.org/).
+ Works in conjunction with [Tachyons.css](http://tachyons.io/), no class name conflicts.

## Yet Another CSS Framework?

No, this one is just an extension of [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/). Full credit goes to Tachyons. I am a huge fan and I use it a lot, I just found that the [flexbox module](https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons-flexbox) class names were verbose and hard to remember so I wanted to create my own. I also wanted something that forced me to use the 38 CSS 2.1 properties that work in all browsers, for when flexbox isn't an option. Lastly, I learned a bunch of HTML best practices from reading [Heydon Pickering's](https://twitter.com/heydonworks) “[Inclusive Front-End Design Patterns](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/inclusive-design-patterns/)” book that I wanted to incorporate into a html starter boilerplate.

In Progress...

- [x] Abbreviate classnames to smaller snippets.
- [ ] Add flex basis, grow and shrink.
- [ ] Add all CSS 2.1 properties for fallbacks.
- [ ] Add an accessible HTML starter template.
- [ ] Add an accessible colour palette.
- [ ] host on unpkg.

#### Opinions

+ Text justification not included (text-align: justify) because it can impair readability. If you need it, add it.
